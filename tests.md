The tests from Allah apply to all experiences in life—both the good experiences and the bad experiences. One is not better or worse than the other; they are actually the same. Each one is a tough test. They are two different kinds of tests designed to check one thing: Did my relationship with Allah get impacted? Did it change depending on whether I was being blessed or restricted?

In the early years of the mission of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam), Allah revealed to him surahs that were shorter in size. Most of the early surahs of the Quran are not very long, and each surah is a unified message. It is a way of delivering the entire essence of Islam, or some of its foundational principles, in a very short, packaged way. This was so that the first people listening to this message, even if they only had a few minutes or seconds, would get the big picture. The details of this religion came over time, but the fundamentals came in this very summarized, succinct manner.

It was so succinct that even the Jinn, upon hearing just a little bit of the Quran, understood the essence and fundamentals of the religion. As they talked about their reaction to what they heard, you can tell that even though they were exposed to very little of the Quran, their understanding became very comprehensive. This is one of the powers of the Quran and one of the great miracles Allah has given us in His book: even a single surah was enough to guide a human being because it was like a seed. The seed contains in it the power to understand the entire tree. Your understanding will grow, enhance, and mature, but the fundamentals are in place.

Something like this is happening in this surah. Allah begins this surah by talking about great powers in history that were much more powerful than the Quraysh. He is talking to the people of Makkah, where the most powerful people were the wealthy elites and tribal leaders. They thought this message—which talks about everybody being equal, the poor having rights, slaves having rights, women having rights, and not pushing the orphan around—was unacceptable. They thought, "How can we treat these people as equal? We're used to being treated as superior. Our wealth and family name make us superior. These people serve us; they are less than us."

So, what Allah does from the very beginning is talk about nations that came in the past who were much more powerful than the Quraysh. If you look at history, the Quraysh might have felt powerful in their small region, but they didn't have any pyramids, castles, palaces, or amazing ruins like the nations of 'Ad or Thamud. Allah says that much more powerful people than you came and went. If you think you're superior, you're nothing compared to them. If you think you're politically superior, you cannot compare to their politics. If you think you're superior in wealth, your wealth is nothing; even their servants may have had more wealth than you. If you think your houses are nicer than everyone's in Makkah, your houses don't even amount to a mud pile in ancient Egypt.

But, Allah says, you have something in common with them. They rebelled in the land. They stood up to and defied Allah's command, just like you're doing. They did this with their prophets, and you are doing this with Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). This you have in common. The wealth and power you do not have in common, but the stupidity you have in common. And people much more powerful than you already paid that price. Allah unleashed his whip on them, and those powerful, magnificent empires that were around for centuries all but disappeared; they got annihilated. So if you have this idea that nobody can touch you because everybody around you is less than you, you're assuming there's no one else. But there is Allah, who is always above you. You will be put in your place. This is the warning Allah was giving in the beginning of this surah.

But then, right after this, Allah uses the word "Fa" (Therefore). In Arabic, "Fa" makes a direct connection between what came before and what comes after. Subject one (nations) is connected to subject two (individuals). This seems unrelated at first, as subject one was about nations, but subject two is about the individual human being. This is Allah's way of telling us that there's a deep connection: what we learn about nations of the past doesn't just apply to nations; it also applies to individuals. The Quran is teaching us this way of thinking about history. Somebody reads about Pharaoh and thinks only a president or prime minister should learn from his example, leader to leader. But the Quran is changing our narrative. All of us should learn that history and think, "Maybe I have some Pharaoh in me, too."

Allah talks about the individual human being—someone who actually believes in Allah, someone who may even have *tawhid* (belief in one God), but their concept of and attitude towards that God is corrupt.

Allah says, "As for the human being, when his Lord tests him..." When you hear about someone being tested, you might think they lost their job, got sick, had a death in the family, or are in a difficult situation. But in this ayah, Allah completely reverse-engineers our concept of a test. He says He tests him, "and [therefore] honors him and showers him with luxuries" (*na'eem*). This person is given great honor and respect, and life is made easy. The ayah didn't begin, "As for the human being that Allah blesses"; it said, "the one who Allah *tests*," an extreme test. And what is the test? You get a lot of respect, and life is good. This is a new idea, but it is connected to what we just learned, because the people Allah just described who were destroyed were very well-respected and had amazing blessings.

This person has a good life filled with blessings, and he responds. You would think Allah would criticize him for saying, "This is my own doing," like Qarun did. But that is not what this ayah is saying. This person actually acknowledges that this all came from Allah, saying, "My Lord has honored me" (`Rabbi akraman`). That sounds like a good thing. If Allah gave you honor and blessings, and you acknowledge He did it, this is accurate. Why is this a problem?

Then Allah describes another scenario: "But as for when He tests him again... and restricts his provision." A limit is put on his health, wealth, luxuries, or comforts. Now, life is becoming more difficult, constricted, and tight. Then this person says, "My Lord has humiliated me" (`Rabbi ahanan`).

What we are actually learning from this is that people can have an immature relationship with Allah. When life is good, Allah is good. "Alhamdulillah." As soon as life gets bad, they say, "I don't know what Allah is doing with me. What punishment is this? What have I done so bad? Ya Allah, come on, enough already. My Lord is humiliating me."

So, your relationship with Allah is good when things are on your terms. The moment things are not on your terms, your relationship with Allah goes bad. It's an unstable, inconsistent relationship; it's like your relationship depends on the weather. Life is about constant changes. You're not always going to be young, healthy, or alive. Someone you love is going to die. If those changes are going to change your relationship with Allah, then you're heading down a path where this immature relationship opens the door to other kinds of corruption.

The thing to take away is that the tests from Allah apply to all experiences in life. The good and bad experiences are actually the same. They are two different kinds of tough tests to check one thing: Did my relationship with Allah get impacted depending on whether I'm being blessed or restricted? Did that actually change? That is the test. It has nothing to do with how much Allah loves me or wants to guide me. Allah loves all of His prophets, but they went through very difficult lives. Other prophets, like Dawud (alayhis salaam) and Sulaiman (alayhis salaam), were given lots of kingdoms and rule. So, having wealth and power does not mean Allah likes you more, and not having them does not mean Allah likes you less. That is an immature understanding.

Then Allah explains who He has honored and who He has actually humiliated. He says one word: "Kalla!" (No!) This means your entire understanding is wrong. This is not how your relationship with Allah should work. Not at all.

"Actually, you do not honor orphans, and you do not encourage yourselves and other people to feed others that need food." There are people in every society and neighborhood not doing so well. But you're like, "So long as I'm doing okay, my people are doing okay," and you think, "Who cares? That's their problem. They brought it on themselves." The people suffering are not your concern.

Why would Allah even say, "honor the orphan"? You don't even know who the orphan is; they don't have a sticker on their face. You have to actually get to know people around you to find out who lost a father. Once you know, it's as if this religion is saying you go out of your way to give them dignity and respect. Why? Because in the ancient world, your dignity came from your father. They've lost their father, so now you must make them feel valued and respected. In societies where youth are abandoned or put in detention facilities, nobody respects them. They get thrown around by the system and end up in crime because nobody honored them or saw their potential.

This is your insensitivity. But it gets even worse. "And you even eat inheritance, devouring it indiscriminately." When a family member dies and you, your sister, your mother, and your uncle all have a share, you take everybody's share because you can. "And you have this intense, permanent love of money." Your relationship with God goes up and down, but your relationship with money is permanent. That's the stable relationship you have.

What Allah has done here is show that when someone says, "Allah has honored me" or "Allah has humiliated me," this has nothing to do with having honor or humiliation. But when you violate these things—when you don't honor the orphan, don't care for the poor, consume inheritance, and have an unfiltered love of wealth where money is first and everything else is second—*then* you have no honor. Then Allah truly has humiliated you.

Truly, even if people respect you, you are humiliated. If you take people's money, you can build the nicest house. The best thieves and crooks have the nicest cars, the highest positions, the most expensive clothes, and the most exotic vacations. They look like they're on top of society. The Quran gives the example of Qarun. He was committing crimes against his own people, and yet he had the nicest house, the nicest ride, and all the servants. When he used to drive by with his entourage, people would say, "Oh man, I wish I were him." So, in the eyes of the poor, that was the most respected person. But in the sight of Allah, that is the most humiliated person.

This is how Allah is teaching us. Nations before you thought that those amazing structures and governments they built would give them respect. Just like you think money will give you respect. But both of you are making the same mistake.
